\section{The Wave Function}
\subsection{The Schr\"odinger Equation}
\definr{Time-Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation}{TDSE}{
    The \textbf{time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation} (TDSE) is given by
    \[
        i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi(x,t) + V(x,t) \Psi(x,t)
    \]
    where $\Psi(x,t)$ is the wave function, $V(x,t)$ is the potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.
}
The Schr\"odinger equation is analogous to Newton's second law, both describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.
\defin{Wave Function}{
    The \textbf{wave function} $\Psi(x,t)$ is a complex-valued function that contains all the information about a quantum system. The square of its absolute value, $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$, gives the probability density of finding a particle at position $x$ at time $t$.
