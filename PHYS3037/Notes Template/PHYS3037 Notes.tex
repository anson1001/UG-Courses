%% Hello! First of all, thanks for being interested in this little thing i
%% have made during my time learning LaTeX. Feel free to use it as you
%% want. I tried to comment everything, and I reduced the document to 
%% the minimum for it to work. Read the theorems.tex to learn more :)
%% If you want to change the color, see theorems.tex as well hehe

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}

% Minimum packages required for it to work (chosen by trial and error xd)

% Head of every page. Depending on the photo, u need to change both \put(x,y) and width=X mm

    Quantum Mechanics\\

\pagebreak

\definr{My first definition}{first}{
    This is my first definition
}

\defin{My second definition}{
    If i don't want to use a reference, i can use the commands without the last r 
}

I can reference an environment by its code like \nameref{defin:first}

\theor{My first theorem}{first}{
    This is my first theorem
}

Because of the different labels, i can use the same code and reference \nameref{theo:first} without contradictions

\exr{My first example}{first}{
    This is my first example.
}

I can also reference examples like \nameref{ex:first} \\

\demo{
    This is my first demonstration
}
